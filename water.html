        <caption>Cannabis, being an extremely water-intensive crop, has the potential to deplete local bodies of water, 
            thereby posing a threat to local wildlife and humans.</caption>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Northern California Coast, where a large portion of American marijuana is grown, 
                an estimated 22 liters of water or more per plant per day are applied during the growing season  
                <ul>
                    <li>This equates to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>approximately 3 billion L per km2 of greenhouse-grown marijuana per growing season.</li>
                            <li>approximately 430 million L per km2 of outdoor-grown marijuana per growing season</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </li>
                    <li>Compared to other crops:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wine: wine grapes on the California north coast are estimated to use a mean of 271 million L of water per km2 of vines per growing season</li>
                            <li><a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44093.pdf">Higher</a> than that of avocados, almonds, among other crops </li>

                </ul>

            <li>This could deplete the water levels in some streams

                    <li>These problems can worsen in areas with severe droughts, especially in California where a large portion of U.S. marijuana is grown </li>
