    <div class="introduction-text">
        Marijuana has become one of the most highly debated topics of the 21st century, 
        especially in the United States where legislation is being passed in its favor. 
        Part of the importance of this subject lies in the profound ripple effect that marijuana has on our environment. 
        This part of the marijuana industry is not commonly discussed, 
        yet it is critical for the future of the cannabis business and well as the future of our Earth.
