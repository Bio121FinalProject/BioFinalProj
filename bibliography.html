        <h3>Preface:</h3>
        <p>Marijuana has become one of the most highly debated topics of the 21st century, especially in the United States where legislation is being passed in its favor. Part of the importance of this subject lies in the profound ripple effect that marijuana has on our environment. This part of the marijuana industry is not commonly discussed, yet it is critical for the future of the cannabis business and well as the future of our Earth. Because of this, I have chosen to study the environmental effects of the legalization of marijuana to promote awareness on this part of the topic that is not talked about very often. </p>
        <p>As more regions around the world move towards marijuana legalization, understanding the environmental consequences becomes pivotal. It is not merely a matter of legality but a profound environmental concern that touches upon issues like land use, water consumption, energy consumption, waste management, and more. The urgency of addressing these challenges is further magnified by the escalating global environmental crisis.</p>
        <p>The genre of this project will be a website. I am a Computer Science major; therefore, I have lots of experience with coding and web design. I would love to apply these skills to environmental biology. I plan to publish my website using a public domain so that everyone can access my project. My audience is not anyone in particular – just people who have an interest in the topic of marijuana and would like to learn more about its effects on the environment. I would say that my audience would be readers in the United States, however, because I plan on discussing lots of American legislature. This also means that my audience could also include lawmakers who may need to learn more about the issue. </p>
        <p>As previously stated, the primary purpose of this project is to inform. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the environmental consequences associated with the legalization of marijuana. By presenting a well-researched and balanced perspective, I aim to empower readers with the knowledge necessary to engage in informed discussions, advocate for sustainable practices, and influence policymaking in this domain.</p>
        <p>My observations and conclusions will be drawn from accredited sources (included below), giving me the authority to write about this topic. I have kept up to date with legislation surrounding this topic for years, which will add to my knowledge of the topic along with these sources. Additionally, I have studied environmental changes for many years, both in my high school science classes as well as my environmental biology class at Providence College. </p>

            Oct. 2023. 
        </p>
        <p>This is the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s website on cannabis, specifically its interaction with our environment. It is broken up into multiple subsections. The first is habitat loss and fragmentation. This is an issue because cannabis cultivation could damage the homes of many plants and animals yet can be avoided with proper practices. Water diversion is also mentioned, as cannabis cultivation can impact water availability. Dams and stream crossings are sometimes created for cannabis farms, which can cause problems to aquatic species. The use of pesticides and fertilizers can cause problems as well. Cannabis farmers (as well as all other farmers) are required to abide by certain laws that limit the usage of certain pesticides. As explained in this website, they can have many consequences on the environment, especially when they runoff into water sources that are crucial to local wildlife. The last sections included in this website discuss light pollution and noise pollution – two issues that are rarely thought of when thinking about environmental issues. 
            I really like this source. This information is laid out very clearly, and a variety of different environmental issues are discussed. It also follows the CRAP test:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currency: There is no publication date for this specific page, however the CDFW website is updated very often, as reflected with their various publications including those on cannabis. </li>
            <li>Reliability: The CDWF is a very reliable source, as they include information from accredited studies (some of them conducted by themselves).</li>
            <li>Authority: The CDWF is a government organization, giving them the authority to write about a topic like this.</li>
            <li>Purpose: The purpose of this page is to inform people about proper practices for cannabis cultivation. It is written specifically for Californians as it is from a Californian government organization, however it can be used as a resource by any with an interest in the topic. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>At first, I chose this source because it was from a government organization. As explained by the CRAP test, government sources are very reliable places to get information. They provide a different perspective than other sources, for they are concerned with the well-being of their citizens in mind. This source does not go super in-depth into the specific environmental subtopics, which is okay for the way I am using this source. This is the first source I focused on, meaning that it is providing a general outline of the issue that I can further investigate with other sources. One example of this is with water use. This subtopic is briefly discussed in this source, but I wanted to learn a bit more about it. I was able to do so with another source (which will be described next) that provides much more in-depth studies and statistics about how cannabis farmers are affecting nearby water sources. </p>

            Need to Know." Environmental Science and Technology Letters, vol. 8, no. 2, 2021, pp. 98-107. 
        <p>This source is a piece from an academic journal that provides a long review of peer-reviewed research on cannabis cultivation and its effects on the environment. It goes into specifics on six different environmental subtopics: land-cover change, water use, pesticide use, energy use, air pollution, and water pollution. The paper analyzes a variety of figures, statistics, and literature to demonstrate the link between marijuana and the environment. All the outside sources they use are peer-reviewed and properly conducted. The most interesting thing that this study notes is the fact that research on this topic is still somewhat underdeveloped. More partnerships between research scientists and cannabis farmers are needed to collect the proper information on this crop’s effect on the environment. If this can be done, advances in science could be used to minimize and damage to the environment that cannabis cultivation may cause, and even make the cultivation process more efficient for farmers. 
            This is an amazing source because it draws from a variety of sources, all of which are very reliable. This source itself shows no bias and follows the CRAP test:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currency: This source is from 2021. Although this was two years ago, the information is still accurate and does not contradict any of the other research I have done (so far). </li>
            <li>Reliability: Environmental Science and Technology Letters is a reliable journal that has published thousands of scientific papers that are all peer reviewed. The container site of this article, ACS Publications, is also a trusted site that fact checks and peer reviews all of their articles. </li>
            <li>Authority: All the contributors to this paper are respected scientists that graduated from highly selective universities. Each of their backgrounds are included in the ACS website. They all declare no competing financial interest for this paper. </li>
            <li>Purpose: To inform about the link between marijuana and the environment, and to promote more research on the subject. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This source is going to be very helpful for my project. Unlike the previous source, it goes very in-depth into its subtopics. The paper draws from a variety of sources, all of which are peer-reviewed, meaning that this information is very reliable. One inspiration I have gotten from this source is the use of charts and graphs. I would love to include my own visuals like this source does on my website. I could create them using the information in this paper along with the other sources I will draw from. Another inspiration comes from the fact that there is still lots of research to be done in the field, and I could make a note of that on my website. I have not noticed any contradictions between this source and the others that I have read so far. </p>

        </p>
        <p>This source is a news article. It opens describing how marijuana has been legalized in many US states in recent years, and how this has affected our economy. This is a preface for the environmental effects of the legalization of marijuana. The first focus is water. The article talks about a few different studies that have been done in California on water in relation to cannabis cultivation. The next environmental focus is wildlife. Cannabis cultivation has killed wildlife, according to a 2018 study, because more land is needed to grow the crop. Toxic rodenticides and pesticides have also posed issues for fish, birds, and mammals. Pollution is also discussed in this article. Denver is used as an example, as Colorado was the first state to legalize the drug. The article ends by talking about some implications of these issues as well as progress that has been made to prevent them. 
            This article does a solid job of presenting the issue and using respected studies to do so. It follows the CRAP test as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currency: This article is from 2019. That is slightly outdated, however this is not an issue because after taking a close look at the information that is presented, it is still relevant in 2023.</li>

            <li>Purpose: To inform the public about how the increasing legalization of marijuana affects our environment. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a mentioned in my preface, I plan on focusing on the legalization of marijuana in the United States. For this reason, this source is perfect for my project. It mentions how more and more states are legalizing cannabis, and how this has benefited the U.S economy. It is very important to consider the economy when researching my project, as it is likely to have implications for the economy. If the economic incentives for cannabis are high, some farmers or manufactures may prioritize profits over environmental safety. Perhaps I can find even more sources on this issue. Regardless, this source is very solid in explaining the economic incentives of marijuana at a basic level. This source also gives specific examples of research done in U.S. states such as California and Colorado. This, along with the previous two sources, will be very helpful in finding a variety of research done on the topic to further understand it. There does not seem to be any contradictions between this source and the previous two. </p>

        <p>This source is a scientific study and analysis on the effects of marijuana on the environment. The main focus is on California; however the findings and conclusions of this study give very important insights on marijuana cultivation for the whole industry. One of the main conclusions of this study is that properly legislation is needed to limit the negative effects of marijuana cultivation on the environment. They argue that the existing approaches are not sufficient enough to control these rising problems. Another conclusion made is that we as a society are not having enough discussions about marijuana cultivation and its problems. I for one have never even thought about this issue before I researched it, so I entirely agree with this source. This source does a great job of using photos, such are ariel imagery, and graphs to explain its research. CRAP test:</p>

        <p>This source gives me a great perspective on the changes that need to be made regarding marijuana cultivation. This includes legislation, or at least an outline for legislation, that needs to be put forth in order to make a positive change on this growing industry. This source does not just make these suggestions. It explains the research that was carried out by these accomplished researchers. This research includes lots of images. For example, the research includes ariel imagery of land clearly that occurred to make room for marijuana farms. Another image shows and illegally constructed pond that was associated with marijuana farming. I plan on using images similar to these to show the problems that are occurring in this industry.</p>

        <p>Johnson, Renee and Cody, Betsy A. “California Agricultural Production and Irrigated Water Use”. Congressional Research Service. June 30, 2015</p>
        <p>This source talks about the economic implications of agriculture in the state of California. California leads the U.S. in agricultural sales, with nearly $45 billion in 2012, contributing 11% to the national total. Notably, Tulare, Kern, Fresno, Monterey, and Merced counties are prominent in national agriculture. However, water scarcity in California raises concerns about water use for farming, with estimates varying from 40% to 80%. Because of conflicting data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and California Department of Water Resources (DWR), discrepancies are present in reports on agricultural water consumption. Trends show a shift toward permanent orchard crops, driven by market demands for almonds, walnuts, and others. California, with the highest irrigated acreage and water use per acre in the U.S., relies significantly on the Central Valley Project for water supply, prompting Congressional attention due to recent cutbacks and concerns about broader agricultural implications.

        <p>This source focuses on water usage in marijuana cultivation, specifically in Northern California. Despite attempts to regulate cultivation, especially after a 2010 Supreme Court decision, marijuana production remains largely uncontrolled. Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity Counties, known for cultivation, cover 7% of California's land but have only 0.62% of the state's population. As a result, marijuana farming is very prevalent in these areas. The industry poses environmental threats documented by law enforcement and researchers, including habitat loss, stream degradation, and wildlife harm. Concerns about water use have risen due to the plant's high water consumption. Marijuana farms often tap into year-round water sources, impacting nearby ecosystems. The unregulated water demands for cultivation may significantly affect streamflow in rural Northern California watersheds, potentially harming sensitive aquatic species and their habitats.

I would like to have a section in my website that is dedicated to the effect that marijuana cultivation has on water diversion and neighboring aquatic ecosystems. This article makes it clear that this is a big issue and that policies need to be made to regulate water usage in this industry. This source does a great job of using images and maps to explain its points. Many of the sources I have utilized do so, which inspires me to do this same in my website. </p>

        <p>This source focuses on rodenticide use in marijuana farming. Since the 1990s, the number of marijuana growing operations in California, especially in Humboldt, Trinity, and Mendocino Counties, has significantly increased. Note that these counties are the focus for many of my chosen sources because this is where lots of marijuana cultivation takes place. This source highlights the fact that the distinction between legal and illegal operations is challenging due to federal marijuana illegality, resulting in low regulatory compliance. The use of anticoagulant rodenticides to protect crops from wild rodents is widespread, both in legal and illegal MGOs, posing environmental risks. Secondary poisoning of non-target wildlife, including bears, foxes, fishers, squirrels, deer, and birds, has become a concern. Northern spotted owls, a threatened species, face potential exposure to ARs through their prey, the dusky-footed woodrats. A rare case of a freshly dead northern spotted owl near active MGOs emphasizes the need for further research to understand the extent of AR-related impacts on wildlife.

Similar to how I would like to have a section on water usage, I would also like to have a section dedicated to pesticide and rodenticide use in the industry. This source gives me nearly all of the resources I need to do so. The other source I have that touches on pesticide use in this industry is from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. I do not see any contradictions between these two sources – they both agree in the fact that rodenticide use in the marijuana cultivation industry is needed and somewhat regulated, however problems still exist. </p>

        <p>This source discusses how noise pollution has an affect on animal, including humans. Defined as unwanted, disruptive sound, noise can cause various health issues, including hearing impairment, stress, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. The World Health Organization recognizes the harmful effects, labeling noise pollution as an increasing public health problem. The source explains how the Texas Journal of Medical Science highlights that prolonged exposure to noise can lead to hearing loss, interference with communication, sleep disturbances, and overall reduced quality of life. The adverse health effects of noise, as documented by WHO, include hearing impairment, sensitivity to noise, and various physiological and psychological impacts. The article emphasizes the growing problem of noise pollution in urban areas and its impact on both human and animal well-being. In particular, the study focuses on noise-related stressors in animal husbandry, shedding light on the potential negative effects on animals and those tending to them. The challenges posed by noise pollution, particularly in modern city dwellings, are escalating due to population growth, urbanization, and technological developments. The article emphasizes the need for further research to understand the extent of noise-related health impacts and mitigate the growing issue of noise pollution.
